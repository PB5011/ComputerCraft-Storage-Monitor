ComputerCraft:Tweaked storage monitor for Tom's Simple Storage

I coded this simple monitoring system to monitor my Tom's Simple Storage System on Minecraft 1.18 and Minecraft 1.19. This system used a wired modem on the computer, a wired modem on the inventory connector, and a wired modem on the monitors. Advanced computer and monitors were used in this. Did not test with a basic computer. Couldn't be bothered :). The monitor set up was a 2x2 monitor system (I think? I lost the world, kept the code. May have been 2x3.)

To use this code, you will need to either code it into computercraft yourself using "edit program_name_here" and then running it after, or you can download this file, go to your world folder, computercraft, find your computer folder (It's a number), and place the lua file in there. This will require a server restart for it to be recognized, I believe. Note that it may stop running if the chunk the computer or storage is in unloads, or if the server/world restarts. You will simply need to rerun it. This also makes the computer unusable while the program is active.
